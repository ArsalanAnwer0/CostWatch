# CostWatch Architecture

## Overview
CostWatch is built with a microservices architecture deployed on AWS using Kubernetes orchestration.

## Infrastructure Components

### Networking
- VPC with public and private subnets across multiple AZs
- NAT Gateways for secure outbound connectivity
- Internet Gateway for public access

### Compute
- EKS cluster for container orchestration
- Auto-scaling node groups for dynamic scaling
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution

### Data Storage
- PostgreSQL RDS for application data
- Redis ElastiCache for caching
- S3 buckets for object storage

### Security
- Security groups for network isolation
- IAM roles for service authentication
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data

## Services Architecture

### API Gateway
- FastAPI-based central entry point
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing and rate limiting

### Resource Scanner
- Flask-based AWS resource discovery
- Scheduled scanning jobs
- Resource inventory management

### Cost Analyzer
- FastAPI-based cost analysis engine
- Machine learning for predictions
- Optimization recommendations

### Alert Manager
- Flask-based notification system
- Multi-channel alerting
- Escalation policies

### Analytics Engine
- Flask-based analytics and ML
- Predictive modeling
- Trend analysis

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Ansible for configuration management
- Environment isolation (dev, staging, prod)

### Container Orchestration
- Kubernetes for service orchestration
- Helm charts for package management
- Auto-scaling and self-healing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automation
- Multi-stage deployment
- Automated testing and security scanning
