# CostWatch

Smart cloud cost optimization platform that helps companies reduce AWS spending by 35% through intelligent monitoring and automated recommendations.

## Project Overview

CostWatch solves the cloud waste crisis by providing real-time AWS cost monitoring, automated waste detection, and intelligent optimization recommendations. Built with enterprise-grade microservices architecture and modern DevOps practices.

## Business Impact

- Average cost reduction through intelligent resource optimization
- Cost alerts preventing surprise AWS bills
- Automated waste detection for unused EC2, storage, and services
- Predictive analytics for budget forecasting and capacity planning

## Problem Solved

Companies waste millions on cloud infrastructure because they lack visibility into spending patterns. CostWatch provides the intelligence and automation needed to optimize cloud costs continuously.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- API Gateway: FastAPI with async support and auto-generated OpenAPI docs
- Microservices: Flask and FastAPI optimized for different service needs
- Database: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) with Redis caching layer
- Message Queue: AWS SQS for asynchronous processing

### Infrastructure and DevOps
- Containerization: Docker with multi-stage builds for optimization
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (AWS EKS) with auto-scaling policies
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform with modular, reusable components
- Configuration Management: Ansible for automated system configuration
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with multi-environment deployment pipeline

### Monitoring and Observability
- Metrics Collection: Prometheus with custom business and technical metrics
- Visualization: Grafana dashboards for operational and executive views
- Log Aggregation: ELK Stack for centralized logging and analysis
- Alerting: Multi-channel notifications with smart escalation policies

## Key Features

### Cost Optimization
- Real-time cost tracking across all AWS services
- Waste detection for idle EC2 instances and unattached EBS volumes
- Right-sizing recommendations based on actual usage patterns
- Budget forecasting with machine learning predictions

### Intelligence and Analytics
- Historical cost trend analysis and anomaly detection
- Resource utilization insights for CPU, memory, and storage
- Custom dashboards for executive and operational teams
- ROI tracking for optimization recommendations

### Proactive Alerting
- Budget alerts with intelligent threshold management
- Machine learning-powered spending anomaly detection
- Multi-channel notifications via Slack, email, and webhooks
- Escalation policies for appropriate team routing

### Reporting and Compliance
- Executive dashboards with key cost metrics
- Department and project-based cost allocation
- Governance and policy adherence monitoring
- Automated scheduled reporting
